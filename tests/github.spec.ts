// Understanding Github and jenkins:: 

/*
github/bitbucket/gitlab - these are used for version control and code management. 

version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

// Download git from browser and install it on your system.
// You should have an account created in github. 

>> Assume there is no repository created in github.
 1. Create a new repository in github.
 2. Clone the repository to your local system using the command: git clone <repository_url>
 3. Open terminal and provide the git init
 4. git add . (this will add all the files to the staging area)
 5. git commit -m "commit message" (this will commit the changes to the local repository)
 6. git branch -m Main
 7. git remote add origin <repository_url> (this will add the remote repository to your local repository)
8. git push -u origin main (this will push the changes to the remote repository)


// when the git repository is already created, then clone it inside your local. 
1. clone the repository in your local system using below command 
    git clone <repository_url> 
2. After the clone is completed. We need to download all the dependencies using the command npm install
    npm install
    npm init playwright@latest
3. Now make some changes to the existing code and commit the changes to the local repository using below commands
    first create the new branch 
    git checkout -b "PlaywrightCode"
4. git branch (this will show the current branch name)
5. git add . 
6. git commit -m "commit message" 
7. git push // you might see some recommendations to set the upstream branch. If you see that, then use the below command
    git push --set-upstream origin "Branch Name"
8. git push
